[00:00.96] The song has born a brand new day
[00:15.92] Conscience has been cast away
[00:19.28] Evil has been blessed with prays
[00:23.24] Heroes end up in disgrace
[00:27.64] So who will be our savior now
[00:30.90] That judge your angels to the ground
[00:34.83] It's a lonely road to absolution
[00:39.47] We must walk alone
[00:47.11] We must walk alone
[00:50.59] We can't take back, the days we've borrowed
[01:02.67] No more time to kill tomorrow
[01:07.16] No more time to kill tomorrow
